# HITCH8
Project files for a 8-bit homebrew CPU

This repository holds a set of files used to design a homebrew CPU based on a Harward architecture, an 8-bit bus and 8-bit registers, just for educational purposes.

The name is an acronym paying homage to Douglas Adams' novel _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_:

**H**omebrew\
**I**C-based\
**T**actical\
**C**PU (for)\
**H**itchhikers (with)\
**8**-bit (architecture)

This project is intended as a purely recreational diversion for electronics and computer science enthusiasts. The author is aware that the choices made for this project are far from the efficiency of professional CPUs: he just wanted to put into practice all the stuff learned at University :slightly_smiling_face:

## Content of the repo

In this repo you will find:

- 2 logisim project, namely "HITCH8_w_buttons.circ", that is the first project in which every circuital block must be activated by hand, and "HITCH8.circ", the current project in which buttons are replaced by control unit signals;

- A directory "microcode" with the commented microcode (i.e. the memory to be stored in the microcode EEPROM, inside the control unit) and the uncommented microcode to be loaded;

- A directory "programs" with all the assembly programs so far created, to be loaded in program EEPROM;

- An .xlsx worksheet with important information regarding the instruction set and microcode memory.

## Blocks
